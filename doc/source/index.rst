Welcome to zqtable's documentation!
===================================

Zqtable is an (almost) pure Python class that is intended to represent tabular and time-sequence data. It can be used where whole-table operations are required.

Zqtable is built with an emphasis on simplicity, both in interface and internal design rather than performance or scalability. Before choosing this package you might wish to consider alternatives such as Pandas.
