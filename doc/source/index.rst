ZqTable
=======

ZqTable is a class intended to represent tabular data. It is written in (mostly)
pure python with an emphasis on simplicity. 

Most users will prefer to use a more mature table class (e.g. Pandas), however
ZqTable may be preferable in a case where simplicty of use and fewer dependencies are required.
